# Logistic Regression Implementation in Python

I created a class named `LogisticRegression` in the `logisticregression.py` file which creates an empty model

The `fit` function in the class is used to fit data to the model so as to train it

The `predict` function accepts a value for x and a threshold then returns the corresponding y as output which is either 1 or 0 for binary classification

The `predict_proba` function acceps a value for x and returns the probability of it being either 0 or 1

The code also includes a sample demo showing it's implementation
